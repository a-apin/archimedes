"""Data-quality / fetch-verification harness for the backtest universe (#772).

Before a ticker is admitted to ``GLOBAL_ASSETS`` — the universe over which the
Tier-1 rigor gate's per-strategy Deflated Sharpe Ratio (Bailey & López de Prado
2014) and the library-level Probability of Backtest Overfitting (CSCV; Bailey,
Borwein, López de Prado & Zhu 2014) are computed — its price history must be
*clean*. Both statistics assume a gap-free, survivorship-aware return series;
violate that and the realized Sharpe is silently inflated and the gate is
poisoned. yfinance's long tail (the #759 expansion to 200–300 instruments) is
exactly where this bites: delisted names vanish, histories start late, and the
fetch layer pads/truncates partial series.

This harness verifies four properties per instrument over the backtest window:

  1. **fetchable**     — a non-empty series comes back at all;
  2. **sufficient history** — it starts near ``start`` and covers ≥ a minimum
     fraction of the window's trading days (no late-IPO / short-history bias);
  3. **gap-free**      — within [first, last] the fraction of missing trading
     days is below a tolerance (holidays are ~3.5% of business days, so the
     default 10% tolerance admits real calendars but rejects true gaps);
  4. **survivorship-clean** — the series still trades near ``end`` (a series
     that stops early is a likely delisting → survivorship bias).

A ticker is admitted only if all four hold. We never pad or truncate to force a
pass — bad data is flagged and excluded (#772 anti-goal).

The single yfinance call is isolated in ``_download_close`` so tests mock exactly
one boundary (or inject ``_downloader=``) and never touch the network.
